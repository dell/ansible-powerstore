Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- A Dell PowerStore storage system version 3.6.0.0 or later.
- PyPowerStore.

  interval (False, str, None)
    String variable. Indicates the interval between Snapshots.

    When creating a Snapshot rule, specify either :emphasis:`interval` or :emphasis:`time\_of\_day`\ , but not both.


  desired_retention (False, int, None)

    It is required when creating a new Snapshot rule.


  time_of_day (False, str, None)
    String variable. Indicates the time of the day to take a daily Snapshot, with the format "hh:mm" in 24 hour time format.

    :literal:`false` specifies to retain all previously created Snapshots while deleting this rule.


  state (True, str, None)
    String variable indicates the state of Snapshot rule.

    For "Delete" operation only, it should be set to :literal:`absent`.

    For all Create, Modify or Get details operation it should be set to :literal:`present`.


  array_ip (True, str, None)
    IP or FQDN of the PowerStore management system.


  validate_certs (optional, bool, True)
    Boolean variable to specify whether to validate SSL certificate or not.

  snapshotrule_state (False, str, None)
    String variable. Indicates the state of a snapshotrule in a protection policy.

    When snapshot rules are specified, this variable is required.

    Value :literal:`present-in-policy` indicates to add to protection policy.

   - In PowerStore version 3.0.0.0, protection policy without snapshot rule/replication rule is not allowed.
   - The :emphasis:`check\_mode` is not supported.
   - The modules present in this collection named as 'dellemc.powerstore' are built to support the Dell PowerStore storage platform.
